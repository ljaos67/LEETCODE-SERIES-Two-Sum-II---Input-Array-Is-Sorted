# LEETCODE-SERIES-Two-Sum-II---Input-Array-Is-Sorted
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 &lt;= index1 &lt; index2 &lt;= numbers.length.
